# Birthday Card

A responsive birthday card built using **HTML and CSS**. This project uses **media queries**, `%`, and `rem` units to make the card, text, and buttons adapt to different screen sizes.  

The card includes:
- A heading with emojis 🎉
- Paragraph text
- Buttons to "Send" or "Share" the card
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile screens
- Sections that appear when buttons are clicked

This project reflects my progress in learning CSS and building responsive layouts. I am still learning more concepts, but this shows what I’ve applied so far.
